# travel-site

This is a landing page for a travel website I built following [Brad Schiffs course](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/) on Udemy.

It eas built using PostCSS, Webpack and Babel. It is hosted on Netlify [here](https://cvescapes.netlify.com). It also has an exaple usage of Netlify's Cloud Functions at branch 'site-for-learning'.
